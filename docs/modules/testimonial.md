# Testimonial Module

The Testimonial module displays customer quotes, reviews, and endorsements with an author photo, name, job title, and company attribution.

## Overview

The Testimonial module provides a structured way to present social proof on your website. Each testimonial includes a quote body, author image, author name, job position, and company name, all arranged in a clean, professional layout. A decorative quote icon reinforces the visual identity of the module, making it immediately recognizable as a customer endorsement.

Social proof is one of the most effective conversion tools available to website owners. By placing testimonials near calls to action, pricing sections, or service descriptions, you provide visitors with third-party validation that builds trust and reduces hesitation. The Testimonial module makes this easy by combining all the necessary elements into a single, cohesive block.

The module supports both portrait and landscape orientations, allows you to toggle individual elements on or off, and provides granular typography controls for every text element. You can style the quote icon, adjust image dimensions, apply background overlays, and animate the module on scroll. When combined with Divi's row column structures, you can build multi-column testimonial grids, alternating layouts, or single featured endorsements.

## Use Cases

1. **Customer Reviews Section** — Place multiple Testimonial modules in a multi-column row to build a reviews grid on a landing page. Each column can hold a different customer quote, creating a mosaic of social proof that visitors can scan quickly.

2. **Featured Endorsement** — Use a single Testimonial module in a full-width row as a featured quote between content sections. Increase the font size of the body text and apply a background color to the section to make it stand out as a visual break in the page flow.

3. **Case Study Highlights** — Pair the Testimonial module with a Blurb or Text module to attribute a quote to a specific project or result. Position the testimonial alongside metrics or outcomes to reinforce credibility with concrete data.

## How to Add the Testimonial Module

1. **Open the Visual Builder** on the page where you want the testimonial to appear. Click the gray plus icon inside any row to open the module picker.

2. **Search for "Testimonial"** in the module picker search bar, then click the Testimonial module to insert it into the row.

3. **Configure the module** by entering the author name, job title, company name, and testimonial body text in the Content tab. Upload an author portrait image and adjust the design settings to match your site's style.

    line-height: 1.8;
}

/* Make the author image circular */
.et_pb_testimonial_portrait {
    border-radius: 50%;
    border: 3px solid #2ea3f2;
}

/* Change the quote icon color and size */
.et_pb_testimonial::before {
    color: #2ea3f2;
    font-size: 28px;
}

/* Card-style testimonial with shadow */
.et_pb_testimonial {
    background: #ffffff;
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
    padding: 40px;
    border: none;
}

/* Responsive padding adjustments */
@media (max-width: 980px) {
    .et_pb_testimonial {
        padding: 24px;
    }
}
```

### PHP Hooks

```php
/**
 * Add a star rating above each testimonial body.
 */
function add_testimonial_stars( $output, $render_slug ) {
    if ( 'et_pb_testimonial' !== $render_slug ) {
        return $output;
    }

    $stars = '<div class="testimonial-stars" style="color: #f5a623; margin-bottom: 12px;">';
    $stars .= str_repeat( '&#9733;', 5 );
    $stars .= '</div>';

    // Insert stars before the testimonial description
    $output = str_replace(
        '<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description">',
        '<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description">' . $stars,
        $output
    );

    return $output;
}
add_filter( 'et_module_shortcode_output', 'add_testimonial_stars', 10, 2 );
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Testimonial Grid** — Place three Testimonial modules inside a three-column row. Give each a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow to create a card-based grid. Set consistent padding across all three and use the same image size for visual uniformity.

2. **Featured Quote with Background** — Use a single Testimonial module in a full-width row. Apply a dark background color or image to the section, switch the text color scheme to light, increase the body font size, and center-align all text. This creates a bold visual break that draws attention to a key endorsement.

3. **Rotating Testimonials** — Combine the Testimonial module with Divi's Slider module by placing individual testimonials on each slide. Alternatively, stack multiple toggles in a single column and use conditional display logic or JavaScript to cycle through them automatically.

## Saving Your Work

After configuring your Testimonial module, click the green checkmark at the bottom of the settings panel to save the module settings. Then save the page using the purple save button in the bottom dock of the Visual Builder. You can also use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Cmd + S` (Mac) to save quickly. Consider saving to the Divi Library if you plan to reuse the same testimonial configuration across multiple pages.

## Version Notes

!!! note "Divi 5 Only"
    This page documents Divi 5 behavior exclusively. The Testimonial module in Divi 5 uses updated CSS class structures and the new options framework. Custom CSS selectors from Divi 4 may need adjustment.

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "Author Image Not Displaying"
    If the author portrait image does not appear on the front end, check the following:

    - Confirm the image has been uploaded and saved in the Image field under the Content tab
    - Verify the image file still exists in the WordPress Media Library
    - Check that image dimensions are reasonable (recommended: 90x90px minimum)
    - Inspect the Image settings in the Design tab to ensure the width and height are not set to zero

!!! warning "Quote Icon Missing or Misaligned"
    If the decorative quote icon disappears or overlaps other content:

    - Verify that the Quote Icon toggle is enabled in the Elements section of the Content tab
    - Check the Icon Size and Icon Color settings in the Design tab to ensure the icon is visible against the background
    - If using custom CSS, inspect for `display: none` or `overflow: hidden` rules that may affect the pseudo-element

!!! warning "Text Styles Not Applying Consistently"
    If typography changes in the Design tab do not reflect on the front end:

    - Each text element (body, author, position, company) has its own typography group; confirm you are editing the correct one
    - Clear any site caching plugins and browser cache after making changes
    - Check for conflicting styles from your child theme or third-party plugins using the browser inspector
