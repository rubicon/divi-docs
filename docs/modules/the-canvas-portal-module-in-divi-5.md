# The Canvas Portal Module in Divi 5

The Canvas Portal module injects content from a detached canvas into a specific spot on your main canvas or Theme Builder template. Instead of letting Divi auto-append canvas content when an interaction triggers, the Canvas Portal renders that canvas exactly where you place it.

## Overview

This makes the module essential when position matters: mega menus anchored to a header link, popups placed relative to a CTA, or reusable content blocks dropped into specific layout spots.

## Adding the Canvas Portal Module

When you load the Visual Builder, Divi automatically adds a **[Section](https://intercom.help/elegantthemes/en/articles/9996489-the-divi-regular-section)**.

1. Click the **Green Plus** icon to insert a **[Row](https://intercom.help/elegantthemes/en/articles/10316106-the-divi-row)**.
2. Click the **Gray Plus** icon inside the Row, which will show the list of all available Divi modules.
3. Find the **Canvas Portal Module** and click on it to load it. Alternatively, you can use the Search option to find it.

## Use Cases

1. **Mega menu anchored to a header link**: Build an off-canvas mega menu on its own canvas, then drop a Canvas Portal inside the text or link module that holds the parent menu item. The mega menu renders relative to the link, so it opens exactly where you need it instead of appearing in a default off-canvas position.
2. **Newsletter popup with precise placement**: Design a newsletter popup in a detached canvas and use a Canvas Portal to inject it into a specific section of the page. Combine it with an on-load interaction and a delay, and the pop-up appears in the right spot at the right time while staying out of your way in the builder.
3. **Reusable content blocks across pages**: Build global content such as pricing tables, testimonial sliders, or announcement banners inside a global canvas. Drop a Canvas Portal into any page or Theme Builder template to display that canvas wherever you need it. Update the source canvas once, and every Canvas Portal reflects the change.

## Settings & Options

Once you've added the Canvas Portal Module, the module settings automatically pop up. These settings are organized into three tabs: **Content**, **Design**, and **Advanced**.

### Content Tab

The Content tab is where you pick the canvas the module displays, along with link and background styling.
