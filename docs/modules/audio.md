!!! tip "When to Use This Module"
    - You need an inline audio player with playback controls on a page
    - Podcast or music pages where cover art and metadata should display alongside the player
    - Audio lessons, meditations, or recordings paired with written content

!!! warning "When NOT to Use This Module"
    - You need to embed video content → use [Video](video.md)

    - You need background audio that plays automatically → use a [Code](code.md) module with custom JavaScript

## Overview

The Audio module provides a fully styled, browser-native audio player that you can drop into any page layout. It wraps the standard HTML5 `<audio>` element with Divi's design controls, letting you present music tracks, podcast episodes, voice recordings, or any other audio file with a polished, on-brand appearance.

Beyond basic playback, the module supports an accompanying cover image, making it well suited for album art, podcast artwork, or episode thumbnails. You can also display a title and artist/caption alongside the player, giving visitors the context they need without leaving the page.

Because the module relies on the browser's native audio capabilities, it supports common formats such as MP3, OGG, and WAV. Upload files to the WordPress Media Library and select them from within the module settings, or paste an external URL to a hosted audio file.

## Code Examples

### Custom CSS

```css
/* Style the Audio module container */
.et_pb_audio_module {
    border-radius: 12px;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}

/* Style the cover image area */
.et_pb_audio_module .et_pb_audio_cover_art {
    max-width: 200px;
    border-radius: 8px;
}

/* Style the track title */
.et_pb_audio_module h2 {
    font-size: 22px;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin-bottom: 4px;
}

/* Customize the playback controls bar */
.et_pb_audio_module .mejs-container {
    background: transparent;
}

.et_pb_audio_module .mejs-controls .mejs-time-rail .mejs-time-total {
    border-radius: 4px;
}

/* Responsive adjustments */
@media (max-width: 980px) {
    .et_pb_audio_module .et_pb_audio_cover_art {
        max-width: 150px;
    }
    .et_pb_audio_module h2 {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}
```

### PHP Hooks

```php
/* Filter the Audio module output */
add_filter('et_module_shortcode_output', function($output, $render_slug) {
    if ('et_pb_audio' !== $render_slug) {
        return $output;
    }
    // Example: add a download link after the player
    $output .= '<a href="#" class="audio-download-link">Download Episode</a>';
    return $output;
}, 10, 2);
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Podcast Show Notes Layout** — Place the Audio module at the top of a blog post, followed by a text module with episode show notes and timestamps. Set a branded cover image and use the title field for the episode name.

2. **Music Portfolio Grid** — Arrange multiple Audio modules in a multi-column row to create a grid of playable tracks. Give each a unique cover image and keep titles short so the layout stays compact and scannable.

3. **Background Ambience Player** — Use a single Audio module in a sticky footer or sidebar section to provide ambient background audio. Style it with a minimal design, reduced spacing, and subtle colors so it does not compete with primary content.

## AI Interaction Notes

!!! warning "Create vs. Modify"
    Modifying existing module content via REST API (`wp.apiFetch` PATCH) updates
    title, body text, and settings attributes. **Creating new modules via REST API**
    produces content that renders on the front end but may not appear in the Visual
    Builder layer view. Use browser automation for reliable module creation.
    See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md).

**Block identifier:** `divi/audio` — *Needs verification on current build*

| Operation | Method | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Read content | Parse `post_content` block JSON | Observed | Use brace-depth parser — see [Content Encoding](../internals/content-encoding.md) |
| Modify existing | `wp.apiFetch` PATCH on post endpoint | Observed | Update block attributes in `post_content` |
| Create new | Browser automation (Playwright) | Observed | REST creation may break VB visibility |
| Batch modify | Sequential REST requests | Needs Testing | See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md) |

**Key content attributes** — *JSON paths need verification*:

| Attribute | JSON Path | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Audio URL | `attrs.audio` | Source URL of the audio file |
| Title | `attrs.title` | Track or episode title |
| Artist | `attrs.artist` | Artist or creator name |
| Image URL | `attrs.image_url` | Cover artwork image URL |

!!! tip "Module Selection Guidance"
    For audio playback use Audio; for video use Video; for background music consider custom code.

## Saving Your Work

After configuring the Audio module:

- **Save changes** — Click the purple **Save** button at the bottom of the Visual Builder, or press `Ctrl+S` (Windows) / `Cmd+S` (Mac).
- **Exit the builder** — Click the **X** button or use `Ctrl+Shift+E` to return to the WordPress dashboard.

## Version Notes

!!! note "Divi 5 Only"
    This page documents Divi 5 behavior exclusively.

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "Audio File Not Playing"
    If the player appears but no audio plays, verify that:

    - The audio file URL is accessible and not behind authentication
    - The file format is supported by browsers (MP3 is the most widely compatible)
    - Your hosting server allows direct file access and has not blocked the MIME type

!!! warning "Cover Image Not Displaying"
    If the uploaded image does not appear beside the player:

    - Confirm the image was uploaded to the Media Library and the URL is valid
    - Check that Design tab image sizing settings are not collapsing the image to zero dimensions
    - Verify no custom CSS is hiding the `.et_pb_audio_cover_art` element

!!! tip "Player Looks Unstyled or Broken"
    The Audio module relies on the MediaElement.js library bundled with WordPress. If the player appears as a plain HTML5 control, check that no optimization plugin is deferring or combining the mediaelement scripts incorrectly. Exclude `wp-mediaelement` from script optimization to restore styling.
