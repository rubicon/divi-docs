!!! warning "When NOT to Use This Module"

## Overview

The Woo Related Products module displays products that share categories or tags with the product currently being viewed. WooCommerce determines the relationship automatically based on the product's assigned categories and tags, then the module renders those related products in a styled grid. This encourages customers to continue browsing after viewing a product, increasing time on site and the likelihood of additional purchases.

The module provides control over how many related products appear, how they are arranged in columns, and how they are sorted. You can also filter related products by specific categories using the Included Categories setting, which narrows the suggestions to products from particular categories rather than showing all category-matched results. The Product Offset setting allows you to skip a number of products from the results, useful for preventing the same related products from appearing across similar product pages.

Each product card in the related products grid can display the featured image, product name, price, star rating, and sale badge. These elements are individually toggleable, giving you control over the density of information displayed. The grid includes image overlay controls for hover effects, adding a polished interactive feel to the product suggestions.

This module is one of the key building blocks for custom product page templates in the Theme Builder. It pairs well with the main product content modules (title, price, images, description) and creates a complete product page experience that encourages continued shopping.

!!! info "WooCommerce Required"
    This module requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated. It will not appear in the module picker if WooCommerce is absent.

<!-- *The Woo Related Products module as it appears in the Divi 5 Visual Builder.* -->

## Use Cases

1. **"You May Also Like" Section** — Place the module at the bottom of the product page template in a full-width row with a heading above it. Set the Product Count to 4 with a 4-column layout. This is the most common pattern and mirrors what customers expect from major e-commerce sites, keeping them browsing after they finish reading about a product.

2. **Category-Specific Recommendations** — Use the Included Categories filter to show related products only from the same category as the current product. This creates more targeted recommendations — for example, on a running shoe product page, only other running shoes appear rather than all footwear. This increases the relevance of suggestions and improves click-through rates.

3. **Sidebar Product Suggestions** — Place the module in a narrow sidebar column with a 1-column layout and a Product Count of 3-4. Disable the sale badge and rating to keep the display compact. This provides persistent product suggestions alongside the main product content without taking up full-width space.

## How to Add the Woo Related Products Module

1. Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated, and that products have categories or tags assigned so WooCommerce can determine relationships.
2. Open the Visual Builder on a product page template. Click the gray **+** icon to add a new module to a row.
3. Search for "Woo Related Products" in the module picker or find it in the WooCommerce category, then click to insert it.

### PHP Hooks

```php
/* Filter the Woo Related Products module output */
add_filter('et_module_shortcode_output', function($output, $render_slug) {
    if ('et_pb_wc_related_products' !== $render_slug) {
        return $output;
    }
    // Example: Change the related products heading
    $output = str_replace('Related products', 'You May Also Like', $output);
    return $output;
}, 10, 2);

/* Change the number of related products WooCommerce returns */
add_filter('woocommerce_output_related_products_args', function($args) {
    $args['posts_per_page'] = 8;
    $args['columns'] = 4;
    return $args;
});

/* Exclude specific categories from related products */
add_filter('woocommerce_related_products', function($related_posts, $product_id, $args) {
    $exclude_cat_ids = array(15, 23); // Category IDs to exclude
    foreach ($related_posts as $key => $related_id) {
        $terms = get_the_terms($related_id, 'product_cat');
        if ($terms) {
            foreach ($terms as $term) {
                if (in_array($term->term_id, $exclude_cat_ids)) {
                    unset($related_posts[$key]);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return array_values($related_posts);
}, 10, 3);
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Full-Width Related Products Row** — Place the module in a full-width row at the bottom of the product page template with 4 columns and 4 products. Add a section background color that differs from the main content area to visually separate the related products. This is the standard e-commerce pattern that customers expect.

2. **Compact Sidebar Suggestions** — In a two-column product layout, place the module in the narrower sidebar column with 1 column and 3 products. Disable the sale badge and rating to keep the display compact. This provides persistent "browse more" options alongside the main product details.

3. **Styled Card Grid with Overlay** — Enable the image overlay design settings and configure a semi-transparent overlay color with an icon. Apply card-style box shadows and hover lift effects to the product cards. This creates a polished, interactive product suggestion section that invites clicking and exploration.

## AI Interaction Notes

!!! warning "Create vs. Modify"
    Modifying existing module content via REST API (`wp.apiFetch` PATCH) updates
    settings attributes. **Creating new modules via REST API** produces content
    that renders on the front end but may not appear in the Visual Builder layer
    view. Use browser automation for reliable module creation.
    See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md).

**Block identifier:** `divi/woo-related-products` — *Needs Testing*

| Operation | Method | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Read content | Parse `post_content` block JSON | Needs Testing | Use brace-depth parser — see [Content Encoding](../internals/content-encoding.md) |
| Modify existing | `wp.apiFetch` PATCH on post endpoint | Needs Testing | Update block attributes in `post_content` |
| Create new | Browser automation (Playwright) | Needs Testing | REST creation may break VB visibility |
| Batch modify | Sequential REST requests | Needs Testing | See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md) |

**Key content attributes** — *JSON paths need verification*:

| Attribute | JSON Path | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Product | `attrs.product` | Target product for related products lookup |
| Product Count | `attrs.posts_number` | Maximum related products to display |
| Column Layout | `attrs.columns_number` | Number of grid columns |
| Order | `attrs.orderby` | Sort order field |
| Included Categories | `attrs.include_categories` | Category filter for related products |
| Product Offset | `attrs.offset_number` | Number of products to skip |

!!! tip "Module Selection Guidance"
    For related products on product pages use Woo Related Products; for cross-sells on the cart page use Woo Cross Sells; for manually curated product grids use Shop or Woo Products.

## Saving Your Work

After configuring the Woo Related Products module, click the green **Save** button at the bottom of the Visual Builder interface. The module can be saved as a preset for consistent styling across multiple product templates, or added to your Divi Library for reuse by right-clicking and selecting **Save to Library**.

## Version Notes

!!! note "Divi 5 Only"
    This page documents Divi 5 behavior exclusively. The Woo Related Products module in Divi 5 benefits from the updated rendering engine and supports Conditions, Interactions, Scroll Effects, and enhanced layout controls not available in Divi 4.

!!! info "WooCommerce Required"
    This module requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated. Related products are determined by WooCommerce based on shared categories and tags. Products must have categories or tags assigned for relationships to be established. WooCommerce 7.0 or later is recommended for full Divi 5 compatibility.

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "No Related Products Displaying"
    If the module appears but shows no products, verify that the current product has categories or tags assigned in WooCommerce. Related products are determined by shared categories and tags — if a product has no categories or tags, WooCommerce cannot find related products. Also check that other published products share at least one category or tag with the current product.

!!! warning "Same Related Products on Every Page"
    WooCommerce's related products algorithm includes a degree of randomness. However, if you consistently see the same products, it may be because only a few products share categories/tags with the current product. Add more products to shared categories, or use the Included Categories filter to broaden the pool of potential related products.

!!! tip "Related Products Not Updating After Category Changes"
    If you recently changed product categories but related products have not updated, clear your site cache. WooCommerce and caching plugins may cache the related products query. Also verify that the category changes have been saved and the products are still published.
