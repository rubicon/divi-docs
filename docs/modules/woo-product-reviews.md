## Overview

The Woo Product Reviews module pulls review data directly from WooCommerce and renders both the existing review list and the review submission form in a single, cohesive block. Each review displays the reviewer's avatar, name, date, star rating, and comment text. The submission form allows logged-in customers to leave their own review with a star rating and written feedback.

This module is one of the key building blocks for custom product page templates in the Theme Builder. While the [Woo Product Tabs](woo-product-tabs.md) module bundles reviews inside a tabbed interface alongside description and attributes, the Woo Product Reviews module gives you the flexibility to place reviews in their own dedicated section — for example, in a full-width row below the main product details.

The review data comes from WooCommerce's built-in review system. To see reviews in this module, WooCommerce must have reviews enabled under WooCommerce > Settings > Products, and at least one product must have received a review. The module respects WooCommerce's review moderation settings, so only approved reviews appear on the front end.

!!! info "WooCommerce Required"
    This module requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated. It will not appear in the module picker if WooCommerce is absent.

## Use Cases

1. **Dedicated Reviews Section** — Place the module in a full-width row below the main product information to give reviews prominent real estate on the page. This works well for products where social proof is a key conversion driver, such as skincare, electronics, or courses.

2. **Side-by-Side Layout** — Position the reviews module alongside the product description in a two-column row. Customers can read the official description on one side and real customer feedback on the other, providing a balanced view.

3. **Review-Focused Landing Page** — Use the module on a custom landing page template that highlights customer satisfaction. Combine it with the [Woo Product Rating](woo-product-rating.md) module as a summary star display at the top and the full reviews list below.

## How to Add the Woo Product Reviews Module

1. Ensure WooCommerce is installed, activated, and that reviews are enabled under WooCommerce > Settings > Products.
2. Open the Visual Builder on a product page template or any page. Click the gray **+** icon to add a new module to a row.
3. Search for "Woo Product Reviews" in the module picker or find it in the WooCommerce category, then click to insert it.

### PHP Hooks

```php
/* Filter the Woo Product Reviews module output */
add_filter('et_module_shortcode_output', function($output, $render_slug) {
    if ('et_pb_wc_reviews' !== $render_slug) {
        return $output;
    }
    // Example: Add a heading above the reviews section
    $output = '<h3 class="custom-reviews-heading">What Our Customers Say</h3>' . $output;
    return $output;
}, 10, 2);

/* Customize the number of reviews displayed per page */
add_filter('woocommerce_product_reviews_list_args', function($args) {
    $args['per_page'] = 5;
    return $args;
});
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Full-Width Reviews Below Product** — Place the module in a dedicated full-width row below the product details section. Enable all display options (avatar, meta, rating, comment count) and style the star rating color to match your brand. This gives reviews maximum visibility and encourages customers to scroll down and read feedback.

2. **Minimal Review Display** — Disable the author avatar and meta information to create a clean, quote-style review layout. Style the comment text with a slightly larger font and italic styling. This approach works well for premium or luxury product pages where a refined aesthetic is important.

3. **Reviews with Branded Submit Form** — Use the Button design options to style the review submission button to match your site's call-to-action color. Customize the Fields styling to give the textarea a branded border color on focus. This creates a cohesive experience that encourages customers to leave their own review.

## AI Interaction Notes

!!! warning "Create vs. Modify"
    Modifying existing module content via REST API (`wp.apiFetch` PATCH) updates
    settings attributes. **Creating new modules via REST API** produces content
    that renders on the front end but may not appear in the Visual Builder layer
    view. Use browser automation for reliable module creation.
    See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md).

**Block identifier:** `divi/woo-product-reviews` — *Needs Testing*

| Operation | Method | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Read content | Parse `post_content` block JSON | Needs Testing | Use brace-depth parser — see [Content Encoding](../internals/content-encoding.md) |
| Modify existing | `wp.apiFetch` PATCH on post endpoint | Needs Testing | Update block attributes in `post_content` |
| Create new | Browser automation (Playwright) | Needs Testing | REST creation may break VB visibility |
| Batch modify | Sequential REST requests | Needs Testing | See [REST API Content Playbook](../playbooks/rest-api-content.md) |

**Key content attributes** — *JSON paths need verification*:

| Attribute | JSON Path | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Show Author Avatar | `attrs.show_author_avatar` | Toggle reviewer avatars |
| Show Comment Count | `attrs.show_comment_count` | Toggle review count display |
| Show Meta | `attrs.show_meta` | Toggle reviewer metadata |
| Show Rating | `attrs.show_rating` | Toggle star ratings |

!!! tip "Module Selection Guidance"
    For the full review list with submission form use Woo Product Reviews; for the average star rating summary use Woo Product Rating; for reviews bundled with description and attributes use Woo Product Tabs.

## Saving Your Work

After configuring the Woo Product Reviews module, click the green **Save** button at the bottom of the Visual Builder interface. The module can be saved as a preset for consistent styling across multiple product templates, or added to your Divi Library for reuse by right-clicking and selecting **Save to Library**.

## Version Notes

!!! note "Divi 5 Only"
    This page documents Divi 5 behavior exclusively. The Woo Product Reviews module in Divi 5 benefits from the updated rendering engine and supports Conditions, Interactions, Scroll Effects, and enhanced styling controls not available in Divi 4.

!!! info "WooCommerce Required"
    This module requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated. Reviews must also be enabled in WooCommerce settings (WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Enable Reviews). WooCommerce 7.0 or later is recommended for full Divi 5 compatibility.

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "No Reviews Displaying"
    If the module appears but shows no reviews, verify that the product has at least one approved review. Check that reviews are enabled under WooCommerce > Settings > Products. Also confirm that the Content setting is pointed at the correct product (or is set to dynamic on a Theme Builder template).

!!! warning "Review Form Not Showing"
    If the review submission form is missing, verify that WooCommerce review settings allow customer reviews. Check WooCommerce > Settings > Products and ensure "Enable reviews" is checked. Also verify that the user is logged in if WooCommerce requires authenticated users for reviews.

!!! tip "Star Ratings Not Displaying"
    If star ratings are missing from reviews, check that the Show Rating toggle is enabled in the module's Content tab. Also verify that WooCommerce star ratings are enabled under WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Enable star rating on reviews.
