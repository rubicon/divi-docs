# LLM Playbooks

Instruction guides that teach AI assistants how to operate Divi 5.

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **What these are:** LLM-first documentation designed for AI assistants helping users build and modify Divi 5 websites.
    **How to use:** Drop playbooks into your AI assistant's context (system prompt, project knowledge, etc.) before asking Divi questions.
    **Playbooks available:** Design System Setup | Build a Page | Visual Builder Ops | CSS in Divi | Responsive Design | Layout Patterns | HTML Workarounds | REST API Content | Browser Automation | Theme Builder Ops | Known Limitations | Troubleshooting Tree

## What These Are

Playbooks are **LLM-first documentation**. Their primary reader is an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) that's been asked to help someone build or modify a Divi 5 website. Their secondary reader is a human trying to understand how to use AI tools with Divi effectively.

This is fundamentally different from the reference docs in the rest of this site. Reference docs answer "what does this setting do?" Playbooks answer "how do I actually accomplish this task, step by step, without hitting the landmines?"

## Why These Exist

Every Divi user who asks an AI assistant for help gets the same experience: the AI gives advice that sounds plausible but breaks in Divi's specific context. Divi 5's Visual Builder has behaviors, constraints, and quirks that no LLM has been trained on. These playbooks fix that gap.

**How to use them:** Drop one or more playbooks into your AI assistant's context (Claude Project Knowledge, ChatGPT custom instructions, system prompt, etc.) before asking Divi-related questions. The AI will follow the instructions and avoid the documented pitfalls.
